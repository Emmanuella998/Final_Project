3. Follow the prompts to perform the desired operation.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until you exit the program.

### Compiling and Running the Code

* Compile the code: `g++ data_structures.cpp -o data_structures`
* Run the executable file: `./data_structures` (on Linux or macOS) or `data_structures.exe` (on Windows)

## Using the Code
